# Introduction
This application demonstrates an approach to building a business domain agnostic
command interpreter that has been specialised for the energy comparison business domain.

# Architecture
The application is made up of a driver, a parser, a repl and commands and formats. These components
are intentionally decoupled from each other. This provides the benefits listed below:
* the driver can decide what commands and formats should form the vocabulary of the parser
* the parser can be used across different business domains with no code change
* the repl provides interactive access for the User to the parser
* the commands are simple to reason about as they are stateless and single-purpose
* the formats can be easily reused between commands to allow for different possible outputs

## Driver
The purpose of the driver is to provide an entry point into the application.
It creates a repl and parser and finds suitable commands and formats. The commands
and formats are injected into the parser and the parser is injected into the repl to build the final application.

## Parser
The purpose of the parser is to respond to queries by invoking a handler.
The parser composes command-format pairs into handlers. If a query is made
that can be processed by a handler, that handler delegates the processing of
the query to its command and the formatting of that command's output to its format.

## Repl
The purpose of the REPL is to provide the User with interactive access to the parser.
It is coupled to stdin from which it consumes commands and stdout on which it produces results.
It is not integrated with the parser as I want the parser to be able to be used in different ways e.g.
as a command interpreter for commands received over the wire in the form of RESTful API calls.

## Command
The purpose of the command is to calculate the answer to a business domain question.
It is highly coupled to the business domain and its specifics. By designing it as a
stateless, functional component, it becomes simple to think about, change and test.

## Format
The purpose of the format is to decide how a value should be displayed. Like the command,
it is a stateless, functional component that is single-purpose in nature. This makes it
simple to understand, modify and write tests for.
